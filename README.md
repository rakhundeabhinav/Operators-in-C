ðŸ§ª Experiment 3: Conditional Statements and Operators in C++

ðŸ”¹ Aim

To implement basic C++ programs that utilize conditional statements and operators for solving real-world problems such as number analysis, grading, and coordinate positioning.


ðŸ”¹ Theory

Conditional statements like if, else if, and else, along with relational and logical operators, enable a program to make decisions based on input conditions. These are essential for:


=>> Comparing values â€“ such as marks or coordinates 

=>> Making logical decisions â€“ based on multiple conditions

=>> Executing code selectively â€“ when specific criteria are met


In this experiment, the following programs were created:


ðŸ“Œ Positive-Negative Checker
Determines whether the entered number is positive, negative, or zero.

ðŸ“Œ Grading System
Calculates and displays the grade based on the marks entered.

ðŸ“Œ Point Coordinates (Quadrant Checker)
Identifies the quadrant or axis on which a given point lies in the coordinate system.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

Through this experiment, I developed a strong understanding of conditional logic in C++. These programs helped me learn how to:

âœ… Use conditional statements effectively

âœ… Implement value-checking and grading logic

âœ… Analyze coordinates using conditions

Overall, this forms the foundational knowledge for control flow in programming.
