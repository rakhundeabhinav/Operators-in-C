ðŸ§ª Experiment 3: To Study and Implement Operators in C++

ðŸ”¹ Aim:
To study and implement different types of operators in C++ through a sample program.


ðŸ”¹ Theory:

Operators in C++ are symbols used to perform operations on variables and values. The main types include:

Arithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /, %

Relational (Comparison) Operators: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Logical Operators: &&, ||, !

Assignment Operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, etc.

Increment/Decrement Operators: ++, --

These operators help in performing mathematical calculations, comparisons, logical decisions, and variable value modifications.

ðŸ”¹Conclusion:
This experiment helped me understand and apply various C++ operators through practical implementation using user input.
