ðŸ§ª Experiment 3: To Study and Implement Conditional Statements and Operators in C++

ðŸ”¹ Aim:
To implement basic C++ programs using conditional statements and operators to solve real-world problems such as number checking, grading, and coordinate analysis.

ðŸ”¹ Theory:
Conditional statements (if, else if, else) and relational/logical operators allow a program to make decisions based on input. They are essential for:

Comparing values (e.g., marks, coordinates)

Making decisions based on conditions

Executing specific code blocks when certain conditions are met

This experiment involves three programs:

Positive-Negative Checker

Grading System

Point Coordinates (Quadrant Checker)

ðŸ”¹Conclusion:
Through these programs, we learned how to use conditional statements and operators in C++ to make decisions, check values, assign grades, and identify coordinate positions. These form the base of control flow in programming.
